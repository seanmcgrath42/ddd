	Topic: Surface Hacks and Deep Hacks and the change invariant
		Music: skipping fingers in a guitar shape to make it easier to hold = Surface hack.
		Music: skipping the root of the chord to add in an octave of a color tone = Deep hack.
		The interesting thing is that without context, these are indistunguishable.
			
		Software design is like that. Developers look at XML serialized messages and see inefficiences and loose control over data types and think "ugh". Surface view.
		Designed to be truly flexible w.r.t. change = Deep view. Also indistinguisable without context. Its not a hack. not a lazy solution. it is actually optimal given
		the ever present CHANGE.
		I rememember Vienna Development Method. Looking for the invariant in a look. Expand now out to product iteration. What is the invariant? CHANGE.

		Words like "flexible" not well treated  OO was supposed to be flexible becauase the innards could change but the interface remains constant.
		However, in much of the real world of business apps, it is the interfaces that change.
